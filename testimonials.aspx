							Dear Denise & Superior Staff,
							<br>
							We want to thank you for the excellent service Superior Abstract & Title provides us and our clients. We are more and more impressed with each contract, from the Saturday morning closings to the courtesy closings throughout the metroplex. Your team has never let us down, someone is always available to make sure your home closes and your clients are satisfied. The friendly, positive attitudes at Superior always make a difference. We've seen you are not the typical 8-5 title company and we want to thank you for going the extra mile. You have earned our business and referrals.

							You guys are always exceptional in your service.   All of the processors here think the same way.  I am always so happy when I see Superior doing the title.  Please pass this on to your management. Thank you for all you do!

							I have been in the mortgage industry working with title companies for nearly 10 years. I have never in my career worked with such an outstanding team as yours. The staff are punctual, helpful, knowledgeable, professional and friendly. I know that when Superior Title is working on my loans I am in good hands and if ever I need anything it is in my hands right away. Any time I am able to choose the title company on a new file I think of no other than Superior.

							For those of you who have not used Superior, get ready for the best title experience you can imagine.  Their expertise, effort, attitude and accessibility are absolutely unmatched by any title company I have ever worked with!  I have worked with them over two years and have had 100% success.

							It was a wonderful experience and I can't tell you enough how impressed I am with your service.  My borrower has a difficult schedule at her nursing job in Corsicana and we were on a deadline to get her closed and funded last month.  My client had several conflicts on signing day and her day was not going well.  She called me on the way to work as a nurse on the night shift and said it didn’t work out and she hadn't been able to sign before her 7pm shift began.  Unknown to me until noon the next day, your closer took the initiative, called her at work and went to the hospital that very night and made it all happen.  We were able to fund on time because of your closer's dedication. You are definitely my 'go to' title company.  Great Job!!

							I started using Superior Abstract and Title three years ago and right away I knew they were the best title company I had ever worked with.  They returned title work back to us within 24 hours after we ordered our first deal with them and have continued to turn title work back to us on a consistent 24 to 48 hour turn around period on all orders we send to them.  I had never seen that before and still have not seen any other company do what Superior does.
							<br><br>
							Along with the quick turnaround you get excellent and accurate service.   I can always talk to someone when I need to and they know how prepare the Settlement Statements accurately the first time and they do a great job of preparing and helping my customers with the closing process.  In addition to this they always are ready to send a notary to make the closing easier for my customers.
							<br><br>
							They have also helped me with files, of mine, they are not working.  I’ve worked several purchases where the title company was selected by the realtors.  I was in need of proving taxes on our borrower’s real estate and Superior did that for me for free so we could close our deal where the other title company would not.
							<br><br>
							They always go the extra mile and working with Katherine Campbell makes the process even better.  She has helped me promote my business and she is always available to help me.
							<br><br>
							I recommend Katherine and Superior Title and Abstract highly.

							WOW! One of the best things about “Superior Abstract Title” is the customer service. Absolutely #1. I love working with you guys! I have met most of your staff and enjoy working with them. Most often good service is over looked, just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for excellent customer service. I feel very confident about the closing process when we close through Superior. Thanks again!

							Superior Abstract & Title  have been absolutely terrific to work with as a business partner.  The closing process is very efficient and convenient for my customers, not to mention that the fees are very competitive for the services provided.  In  addition to the great title services that the company provides, LisaKay sets herself and her company apart by being very active in networking and helping me build my business.  She understands that the more business I have, the more business she will have in return.  I have never had as proactive of a title partner as LisaKay in maintaining and building our relationship.

							I have been in the industry for over a decade and I have worked with many different title companies all around the state of Texas, and in an industry where customer service can sometimes be difficult to find Superior Abstract & Title have maintained an extremely high customer service level and have built their entire business and reputation around serving their customers and clients. Given my personal business is also built on customer service I would choose NO other title company than Superior Abstract & Title. If you are looking for the best title services for your client & business then you need to search no further, as Superior Abstract & Title is the best in the business hand down.

							Denise and her team are outstanding. They are always flexible with my client's needs and meticulous with my files. There is always a team member to speak with, when I call, so I do not have to wait on call backs. The service of this title company is hard to find in our market. I can always depend on a smooth closing from the title side when I work with them.

							Thanks Denise for you and your team!!!!!

							"SUPERIOR" is just a word and the company name of Superior Abstract & Title. If it is put into action it becomes SUPERIOR Service. This is what many of my Real Estate Professionals and I have experienced. Outstanding Communication with us and our clients are above and beyond expectation and smooth transactions in sometimes frustrating deals have been handled in a professional and caring manner. Even with a client who needed a closing outside of our immediate area the service has been better than expected. Superior Abstract & Title provides a very high level in customer care from Business Development to Closing, Staff and Management even after the Buyers and Sellers closed. Thanks for being a great partner in our Industry and making our lives easier.

							Hi Denise,
							<br>
							I just wanted to take a moment and send my sincere thanks for another incredible effort by Superior Abstract and Title!! It is sometimes almost taken for granted how, with calm professionalism and nimble expertise, Your staff always conquers every challenge in closing a file. Last minute requests for remote close, last second turnarounds for docs, nothing fazes them. This is just one more reason you have my loyalty and all the business I can generate!
							<br>
							Best Regards,
